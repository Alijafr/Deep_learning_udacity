These are my five projects implemented during the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program (2020).
 
  
## 1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Data
<p>
In this project, I built a neural network from scratch (using numpy) to carry out a prediction on a Bike Sharing Dataset.

You can access the data set from here: Bike Sharing Dataset Data Set
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset

Screenshot below shows the prediction vs the real data.

## 2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project
<p>
In this project, I built a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, this algorithm will predict the dog's breeding. 
If supplied an image of a human face, the code will give the resembling dog breed. Examples are shown below.

## 3. Generate TV Scripts
<p>
In this project, I generated my own "fake" TV scripts using RNNs (lstm). 
A sample of a fake tv script is shown below.

## 4.Face Generation
<p>
In this project, I used generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate new faces. Example of the generated faces are shown below.

## 5. SageMaker deployment project (AWS SageMaker)
<p>
This is project is intended to teach us how to build and deploy DL and ML models using cloud computing frameworks such as AWS. 
In this project, I constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. 
In addition, I deployed my model and construct a simple web app which interacts with the deployed model.
